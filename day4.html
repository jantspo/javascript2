					<h2>Object Prototypes/Constructors</h2>
					<p>We learned about objects and how to create them and access their values, but what if we want more functionality out of objects? What if we know we're going to need more than one object with similar properties, but with different values?</p>
					<p>Enter object constructors. Before we talked about real world examples of objects. Let's look at cars again. We said yesterday that cars have makes, models, years, number of doors, etc. These aren't things unique to a single car, but properties that every car has. If we made a list of every property a car can have we'd end up with a long list with many of the items being things that some cars have while others don't. In the end we end up with a list that provides a general idea of what a car is. It's not a specific car, but it's a good of the properties a specific car would have.</p>

					<p>An object constructor is much like that list. Another way to think about it is that in new housing development there are many different houses with different styles. But if you really look you'll notice that even though each house might be a different color or have different style doors, the reality is that all the houses in the neighborhood are based on 4 or 5 basic models and layouts. These 4 or 5 models each have their own blueprint that every house in the neighborhood is built off of. These blueprints are like object constructor. Object constructors are blueprints for objects and the properties they have. </p>

					<p>Let's make a car object constructor so we can create as many car objects as we'd like.</p>
					<pre><code>
function Car(make, model, year, numOfDoors, engineType){
	this.make = make;
	this.model = model;
	this.numOfDoors = numOfDoors;
	this.engineType = engineType;
	this.engineRunning = false;
}
					</code></pre> 
					<p>Done. Now let's break it down. First we declare a function named Car. Notice the capitalization? Object constructor are created with a capitalized first letter. This makes it clear for people looking at our code that this function is an object constructor.</p>
					<p>Next we tell the function what arguments to expect. In this case it should expect a make, model, numOfDoors, and  engineType. Inside our code block we tell the function what to with the arguments we pass in. If we are setting the arguments to properties then we specify what arguments are going to set to which properties using <code>this.propertyName = argument;</code>.</p>

					So now we have a basic object constructor, but no objects. We can create new objects by using the new keyword.

					<pre><code>
var myCar = new Car('Mazda', 3, 4, "inline-4");
					</code></pre>

					<p>In this example we are declaring a variable named myCar and implementing a new instance of our <code>Car</code>. Note that we are not using are object constructor to store this object, but simply using it to create the new object instance.</p>


					<h2>Object Protoype Methods</h2>
					<p>We have a basic object protoype, but now we need to add some methods to it. Methods are function unique to objects. To add a method we use <code>.prototype.methodName</code>. So let's give our object prototype some methods.</p>
					<pre><code>
Car.prototype.startEngine = function(){
	if(this.engineRunning === false){
		this.engineRunning = true;
	}else{
		alert('Loud obnoxious grinding noises');
	}
}

Car.prototype.stopEngine = function(){
	if(this.engineRunning === true){
		this.engineRunning = false;
	}else{
		alert('Nothing happened');
	}
}

Car.prototype.isConvertable = function(val){
	if(val === true || val === false){
		this.convertable = val;
		if(this.convertable === true){
			this.roof = 'raised';
		}
	}else{
		alert("Must be a true or false value");
	}
}

Car.prototype.lowerTop = function(){
	if(this.isConvertable === true){
		this.top = 'lowered';
	}
}
					</code></pre>
					<p>So now our car prototype has some methods. If we create a new instance of our car it will have access to all of these methods. Notice the edge casing in some of the methods? If you look at our last method, <code>Car.prototype.lowerTop</code>, what do you think would happen if you called it directly after creating a new Car? Nothing. The method is dependent on a property that is set in another method. Now if we called the <code>isConvertable</code> method and set it to false it would still do nothing because we haven't added any edge casing for if <code>this.convertable</code> is false. If we were to set it to true, however, and then call the lowerTop method it would work as intended.</p>
					<p>It's important to remember that methods can and often are meant to extend the functionality of an object as necessary. Not all cars are going to be convertables, but if they are one then they automatically have access to the functionality of raising and lowering their roofs. It's important to leep this in mind when <b>method chaining</b>. If you are calling multiple methods on an object in a row then it's important to be sure to call them in the order that is needed to make them work.</p>
